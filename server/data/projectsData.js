      "In this group project, my group and I were tasked in creating, deploying and testing a Web Application using Web Application Frameworks and middleware technologies.\n\nUsing HTML/CSS/JavaScript and frameworks such as Express.js, we created a website and hosted it on Google Cloud. We were required to implement advanced technologies for developing RESTful Web Applications, including MVC, distributed authentication and authorization, secure data communication, web caching and content replication. At the end, we were required to present the application with a demo and a presentation.",

      "Given a dataset of 4,500 images which could be split into three classes, I was required to create a Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Image Classification using Python and Python libraries like Pytorch and SKlearn.\n\nThe aim of this project was to evaluate CNNs through the lens of a challenging image classification task by proficiently utilizing available data for model training and hyperparameter tuning, implementing CNNs, applying these pre-trained models to classify unseen test data, and exploring the nuances of different loss functions and optimization techniques tailored for training CNNs. In doing so, I acquired knowledge and expertise in employing various techniques to boost performance on CNNs.",

      "As a group, we created a 3D game using Unreal Engine 5. Using free assets online, we developed Space Hunters, a 3D Platformer where the goal of the game was to traverse the map and reach the end, where there would be a boss that the player is required to eliminate.\n\nMy role, in this project, was to create the final boss. Here I created a non-player character that would shoot projectiles at the player while tracking him. I also implemented boss stages using enumerators and a health system that was made from scratch.",

      "Using C++ and OpenCV, I was required to create an image manipulation program that could perform various image manipulation techniques such as image filtering, edge detection, image segmentation, and image enhancement.\n\nThe aim of this project was to develop a program that could read an image, apply various image manipulation techniques to the image, and output the manipulated image. This project was a great way to learn about image processing and manipulation techniques and how they can be applied to real-world problems.",
